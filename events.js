        already open and the OS wants to reuse the application to open
        the file. open-file is also emitted when a file is dropped onto
        the dock and the application is not yet running. Make sure to listen
        for the open-file event very early in your application startup to
        handle this case (even before the ready event is emitted).

        You should call event.preventDefault() if you want to handle this event.

        On Windows, you have to parse process.argv (in the main process) to get the filepath.
